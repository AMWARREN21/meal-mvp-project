# RECIPE BOOK

In this project I've used my cumulative knowledge to make a full stack application. For the backend I created CRUD routes in order to update my database on the fly and connected that to my front end. For the front end I gave my page a West Coast vibe with the ability to get all the recipes, edit and delete recipes, and seach for your favorite!.
